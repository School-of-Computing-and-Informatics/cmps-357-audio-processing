# Agent Transcript Summary Outline — cmps-357 Audio-Processing Project

## 1. Startup Script Creation
A `startup.sh` script was developed to:
- Create `.venv` if not present.  
- Activate it and verify FFmpeg installation.  
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
- Run the test suite automatically.

---

## 2. Pip and Build Failures
- Initial `pip install` failed because the virtual environment lacked `setuptools.build_meta`.  
  **Fix:** Added  
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  ```  
  before installing requirements.

- A subsequent error occurred when building **NumPy** on **Python 3.13**, due to removal of `pkgutil.ImpImporter`.  
  **Resolution:** Use Python 3.12 or earlier, since many packages were not yet compatible.

---

## 3. Installing Python 3.12
- The system did not include `python3.12`.  
- The **deadsnakes PPA** method failed, so **pyenv** was used instead to install and manage Python 3.12.0 locally.

---

## 4. Pyenv Configuration
- Installed via  
  ```bash
  curl https://pyenv.run | bash
  ```
- Added the following to `~/.zshrc`:
  ```zsh
  export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
  [[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
  eval "$(pyenv init - zsh)"
  eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
  ```
- Verified with:
  ```bash
  python --version  # → Python 3.12.0
  ```
- Updated `startup.sh` to use the active pyenv Python (`python -m venv .venv`).

---

## 5. System Dependencies
A new file `INSTALL_SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md` documents system packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `libbz2-dev` | Enables bzip2 compression support |
| `libsqlite3-dev` | Enables SQLite 3 support |
| `pyenv` | Python version management |
| `python 3.12.0` | Compatible runtime for dependencies |

---

## 6. NumPy Compatibility
- `numpy==1.24.3` was unavailable for Python 3.12.  
  **Fix:** Updated `requirements.txt` to use  
  ```
  numpy >= 1.26.0
  ```
- The startup script was modified to install a compatible NumPy version when Python 3.12 is detected.

---

## 7. Project Metadata
- `.python-version` (generated by pyenv) defines the local Python version.  
  **Recommendation:** Keep it under version control for consistency across developers.

---

## 8. Test Warnings
- `pydub` produced a `DeprecationWarning` referencing the deprecated `audioop` module.  
  Safe to ignore in Python 3.12. Future updates should remove or replace `audioop`.

---

## 9. Final Environment
- Python 3.12.0 via pyenv  
- Virtual environment `.venv`  
- Updated dependencies (`numpy >= 1.26.0`)  
- Verified `startup.sh` automation  
- Complete setup documentation created

---

## 10. Next Improvements
- Automate OS-dependency verification in `startup.sh`.  
- Pin `pydub` version once Python 3.13 support is released.  
- Extend testing and CI automation using the same environment setup.
